# DC-DC-BUCK-CONVERTER
A buck converter is a power electronic circuit that is used to step down a DC voltage without of much i^2R losses or any other losses. 
Me and my group mates had a hardware model of a unidirectional DC-DC buck converter which can buck a 36V DC value to a range of 5V-36V range which is used to control the brightness of 3 12V LEDs connected in series. We used LEDs as a load to the buck converter. 
The input to the buck converter is directly taken by 230V, 50Hz, 1 phase mains supply. We used a 24-0-24 transformer to step down the main voltage to around 72V peak AC and then used a rectifier circuit to achieve 72V DC. Thus using this 72V constant DC source we made the rest of the buck converter. 
The buck converter is made using a NE555 timer IC, a 20mH Ferrite core inductor which was designed and made by ourselves, 2 Capacitors and few wires along with the LEDs which were our load. Effects such as drop in efficiency because of heating, bi-directional current flow, operation in the discontinuous conduction mode etc. were neglected as this was meant only for demonstartion and educational purposes as a part of our course project and not in a commercial scale.
